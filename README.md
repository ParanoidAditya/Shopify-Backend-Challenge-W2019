# Lets start with K8s and make our way up the list (just like I did with this challenge).

 - Due to the relationship between shops, products, orders and line items. I knew I had to use a relational database. So I went with __Google CloudSQL__ for the deployment

## The Cluster

Regional cluster in `northamerica-northeast1`  with a single Node in each zone, with default api scopes with the exception/addition of access to `Cloud Debugger` and HTTP load Balancer enabled

## kubectl get deployments,svc,ing
1. `ingress-nginx`, `external-dns`, `cert-manager`, `grafana` and `prometheus` deployed with helm (easy)
2. Deployment `api` with container `rest` running a sample node.js application and `cloudsql-proxy` as a sidecar container, updated image of the `rest` automagically with cloudbuild throughout development
3. Deployment `docs` with containers [git-sync](https://github.com/kubernetes/git-sync) & nginx to serve the static api documentation.

4. [shopify.adi.run](https://shopify.adi.run/) ingress with TLS termination at the ingress-nginx-controller


    1. Path `/docs` goes to the docs service
    2. Path `/rest` goes to the api service

## CI/CD because why not?

After the k8s infrastructure was bootstrapped, I setup this simple CI/CD pipeline to update the api service within a few seconds everytime I push to the repo. And NO, I do not develop in production but I may have this time.

Tests (test steps currently commented out) would have been nice to show off and make this a better solution overall
